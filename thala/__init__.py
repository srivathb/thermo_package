THALA: Thermodynamics Helper and Analysis Library for Applications 

THALA is a library for thermodynamics calculations and heat transfer analysis. It provides a set of functions to compute thermodynamic properties, including enthalpy change, work done, and heat transfer rates through conduction, convection, and radiation.

Usage:
------
To use THALA, import the package and its submodules as follows:

    from thala import thermodynamics
    from thala import heat_transfer

Features:
---------
- Thermodynamics Module: Functions to calculate thermodynamic properties and changes for chemical reactions.

- Heat Transfer Module: Functions to calculate heat transfer rates through conduction, convection, and radiation.

For additional details and examples, refer to the README documentation.
